The **B**ioacoustic **R**ecognition AI **N**eural **N**etwork (BRaiNN) team is made up of a group of researchers at the [University of Wolverhampton](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/), lead by [Andrew Gascoyne](https://researchers.wlv.ac.uk/A.D.Gascoyne) and [Wendy Lomas](https://researchers.wlv.ac.uk/W.Lomas), developing AI models for bioacoustic analysis. This repository provides the software to detect common and soprano pipistrelles using a lightweight associative memory Hopfield neural network. 

Feel free to use the software for your acoustic analyses and research. If you do, please cite as:

## Requirements:

matplotlib==3.10.3

psutil==5.9.0  
scikit_learn==1.7.1  
scipy==1.16.1  


## Instructions:

To replicate the results of this paper (citation pending) follow these instructions for the simplest execution:

* Create an empty folder, 'DATA' and then unzip all the dataset files (see citation pending and Bertran et al, 2019). Move all the wav files from PIPI_paper, PIPY_paper, SILENCE_paper and SILENCE2_paper to the DATA folder.
* Set up five empty classification folders in the same location: 'PIPI’, 'PIPY’, 'SILENCE’, 'UNID’, and 'UNCLASS’.
  * PIPI: common pipistrelle
  * PIPY: soprano pipistrelle
  * SILENCE: pre-processed silences
  * UNID: unidentified, i.e. model converges to a spurious state
  * UNCLASS: pre-processed unclassifiable files of echolocation pulses with FmaxE between 49 and 51 kHz (Russ, 2021; Aughney et al., 2018; Catto et al., 2003)
* To classify the raw data run BRaiNN.py
* To examine the results run BRaiNN_analyse_plot.py once the main classification code (BRaiNN.py) has run.
* N.B. The fastest runtimes can be achieved in a command-line interface and without shifting files, however the runtimes reported in the paper include the time taken to move files before analysis.

To analyse/classify longer files or for different species do get in touch with the team and they will be happy to advise on later iterations of the software. We are currently working with captive and wild primate datasets.
